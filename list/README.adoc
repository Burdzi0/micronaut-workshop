== Initialization

 mkdir list
 cd list
 gradle init

Project type: `java-application` +
Build script DSL: `groovy` +
Test framework: `spock` +
Project name: `list` +
Source package: `ch.jug.graalvm.list`

Now, configure the build to add a manifest to the build artifact. Add the following snippet to the end of the `build.gradle` file.

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
jar {
    manifest {
        attributes(
            'Class-Path': configurations.compile.collect { it.getName() }.join(' '),
            'Main-Class': mainClassName
        )
    }
}
----

== The Source

This example program just lists all files from the current directory using the standard Java API. Replace the existing default source code in `App.java` with the following snippet:

.App.java
[source,java]
----
package ch.jug.graalvm.list;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class App {
    public static void main(final String... args) {
        Arrays.stream(new File(".").listFiles())
              .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
----

== Build

We use Gradle, to build the project. You do not needto have Gradle installed!

 ./gradlew assemble

The JAR file will be available in the `build/libs` directory.

== Test with Java VM

Start the program and use the `time` utility to measure the execution time (not available in Windows):

 time java -jar build/libs/list.jar

Start it several times to calculate the average.

== Create Native Image

Use the GraalVM Native Image tool to create a native binary of the program:

 native-image --static --no-server -jar build/libs/list.jar

Depending on your CPU power and IO rate, this might take some time! After it is finished, you will find a runnable file `list` in the root directory of this project.

== Test with Native Image

Start the program and use the `time` utility to measure the execution time (not available in Windows):

 time ./list

Start it several times to calculate the average and compare it to the previous tests. Finally, check that it is really a native executable:

 file list

The `file` command is not available in Windows.
